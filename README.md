# TextTure(Text to Structured)

## Introduction

The TextTure project aims to automatically convert unstructured text data into structured data so that it can be easily stored in a database.
The main goal is to have the Gemma 2B model analyze unstructured text data such as message board posts or comments written by users, categorize it into a structured format, and match it with database fields.
The project automates and simplifies the task of converting unstructured data into structured data, improving the efficiency of data management.
